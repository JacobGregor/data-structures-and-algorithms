# Implementation: Linked-list-insertion

## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

### BIG-O: Linear Complexity O(n);

## API

## Features\

Node

Write a function called breadth first\
Arguments: tree\
Return: list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered\
NOTE: Traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach\

## Specifications

## Challenge Setup & Execution

Branch Name: tree-breadth-first

Challenge Type: Code Challenge / Algorithm

## Testing

Can successfully Return: list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered\
Can Return Error: if given an argument with no root value\
