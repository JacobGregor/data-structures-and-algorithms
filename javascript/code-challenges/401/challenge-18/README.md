# Implementation: k-ary tree -> FizzBuzz

Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a k-ary tree while traversing through it to create a new tree.

Set the values of each of the new nodes depending on the corresponding node value in the source tree.

## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

### BIG-O:

```
Time: Linear O(n);
Space: linear O(n);

```

## API

## Features

Node

```
Write a function called fizz buzz tree
Arguments: k-ary tree
Return: new k-ary tree
```

```
If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.
```

Challenge Type: Code Challenge / Algorithm
```

## Testing

```
works properly if the value is divisible by 3: replaces the value with “Fizz
works properly if the value is divisible by 5: replaces the value with “Buzz
works properly if the value is divisible by 15: replaces the value with “FizzBuzz
