# Implementation: Linked-list-insertion

## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

Constant Complexity O(1) for .insert\
Linear Complexity O(n) for .includes\

## API

### Feature Task\

Write a function called zip lists\
Arguments: 2 linked lists\
Return: Linked List, zipped as noted below\
Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list.\
Try and keep additional space down to O(1)\
You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.\
