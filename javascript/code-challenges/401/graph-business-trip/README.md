## Challenge Setup & Execution

```
Branch Name: graph-breadth-first

Challenge Type: Extending an Implementation
```

## Approach & Efficiency

<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

### BIG-O:

```
Time: O(n);
Space: linear O(n);

```

## Testing

```
  Graph Implementation
    ✓ Add a Vertex (2 ms)
    ✓ Successfully add an Edge to the graph (1 ms)
    ✓ A collection of all nodes can be properly retrieved from the graph
    ✓ All appropriate neighbors can be retrieved from the graph (1 ms)
    ✓ Neighbors are returned with the weight between nodes included
    ✓ testing getNodes to have added the Mapped values to an ordered Set(); (1 ms)
    ✓ A graph with only one node and edge can be properly returned
    ✓ testing getNodes to have added the Mapped values to an ordered Set(); (1 ms)
    ✓  A collection of nodes in the order they were visited.
    ✓ An empty graph properly returns null
